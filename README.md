# Automatic Page Generator From GitHub

This is an automatic page generator from GitHub to create beautiful pages for all of our projects.

## How to use it?

1. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown
2. Select a template crafted by a designer
3. Publish

After your page is generated, you can check out the new gh-pages branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.
